  <p>
    Elite Dangerous is the definitive massively multiplayer space epic, bringing gaming’s original
    open world adventure to the modern generation with a connected galaxy, evolving narrative and 
    the entirety of the Milky Way re-created at its full galactic proportions.
    <br>
    Starting with only a small starship and a few credits, players do whatever it takes to earn 
    the skill, knowledge, wealth and power to survive in a futuristic cutthroat galaxy and to stand
    among the ranks of the iconic Elite. In an age of galactic superpowers and interstellar war, 
    every player’s story influences the unique connected gaming experience and handcrafted evolving 
    narrative. Governments fall, battles are lost and won, and humanity’s frontier is reshaped, all
    by players’ actions.
